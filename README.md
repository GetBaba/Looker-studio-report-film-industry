# Looker-studio-dashboard-film-industry
This is the first ever dashboard I created on Looker Studio. It was for a Data Visualization class, where we had to create a dashboard respecting 
data visualization theory and rules. However, we were free to use any data set of our choice. I decided to use the film industry, as I consider myself to be
quite a cinephile and because it is a domain that I thought my fellow classmates would appreciate more and could approach easily. However, the most important
reason behind this choice of dataset was that it was one of the most complete datasets I could find: with a good time feature (important to show temporal trends, which
is what I wanted to feature the most in my dashboad); very little nulls or unclean data; a good amount of features (that were also easy to use to create more of them
through feature engineering). Please make sure to check it out with the links below!
